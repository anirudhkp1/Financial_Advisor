            "\n",
            "1. **Review High Anomaly Transactions**:\n",
            "   - Look closely at the **63 IQR anomalies** and **38 cash out anomalies**. Identify any unexpected large transactions or patterns that don’t align with your typical spending.\n",
            "   - It’s crucial to determine if these anomalies are necessary expenditures or if they reflect potential overspending.\n",
            "\n",
            "2. **Establish Category Budgets**:\n",
            "   - Given your high anomaly rates in the **Food** and **Travel** categories, consider setting stricter budget caps. For example:\n",
            "     - Set a budget for **Food** expenses at 10-15% of your monthly income.\n",
            "     - Limit **Travel** expenses to a fixed amount each month to avoid unplanned high expenditure.\n",
            "\n",
            "3. **Monitor Cash Outflow**:\n",
            "   - With **55 anomalies detected**, enhance your tracking of cash outflows. Utilize a budgeting app or spreadsheet to categorize and examine your weekly and monthly cash movements.\n",
            "   - Implement weekly spending reviews to ensure adherence to budget caps, allowing you to adjust and react to anomalies as they arise.\n",
            "\n",
            "4. **Frequency Analysis of Rare Categories**:\n",
            "   - Evaluate the necessity of the **3 rare category transactions**. Assess if these are critical expenses or frivolous purchases. If they are non-essential, removing them from future budgets can lead to significant savings.\n",
            "\n",
            "5. **Unusual Timing of Transactions**:\n",
            "   - Investigate the **1 anomaly around transaction timing**. If you find that certain purchases occurred at irregular hours or outside standard buying behaviors, consider whether these transactions indicate impulsiveness or are generally safe.\n",
            "\n",
            "### Next Steps\n",
            "\n",
            "- Begin by categorizing your recent transactions (specifically focusing on the anomalies) to identify regular spending behaviors.\n",
            "- Establish clearer budgeting guidelines and automatic alerts for when spending in certain categories exceeds your predefined limits.\n",
